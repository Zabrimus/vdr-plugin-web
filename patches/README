The browser window has a default size 1280 x 720. To show the images or parts of the images in the OSD,
they must be scaled accordingly. For scaling exists 2 different possibilities:
1. using GraphicsMagick
2. using the outputdevice softhd*

To enable faster scaling via the output device, VDR and the output devices needs some patches.

If at least the VDR patch has been applied either change the Makefile
ENABLE_FAST_SCALE ?= 1
or call make with
make -j ENABLE_FAST_SCALE=1

VDR Patch:
VDR-implement-DrawScaledImage.patch

The right output device patch (one of):
softhdcuvid-draw_image_scale.patch
softhddevice-draw_image_scale.patch
softhddevice-drm-gles-draw-image-scale.patch
softhddrm-draw_image_scale.patch
softhdodroid-draw_image_scale.patch
softhdvaapi-draw_image_scale.patch

Additionally the plugin needs the parameter
"-f" or "--fastscale"
