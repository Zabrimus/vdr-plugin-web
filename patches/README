The browser window has size 1280 x 720. To show the images or parts of the images in the OSD,
they must be scaled accordingly. For scaling exists 2 different possibilities:
1. using FFmpeg sws_scale
2. using the outputdevice softhd*

To enable faster scaling via the output device, VDR and the output devices needs some patches.

VDR Patch:
VDR-scalefactor_image.patch

The right output device patch (one of):
softhdcuvid-draw_image_scale.patch
softhddevice-draw_image_scale.patch
softhddrm-draw_image_scale.patch
softhdodroid-draw_image_scale.patch
softhdvaapi-draw_image_scale.patch
softhddevice-drm-gles-draw-image-scale.patch.txt

Additionally the plugin needs the parameter
"-f" or "--fastscale"
