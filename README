Description:
This plugin is part of a triple of applications, which works together to show HbbTV pages and videos in directly in VDR.

Optional patches:
A patch for VDR and several output devices can be found in directory patches. These patches allows the usage of image
scaling using OpenGL instead of the slower GraphicsMagick.
